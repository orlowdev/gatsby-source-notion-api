Gatsby source plugin for working with official [Notion](https://notion.so) API.

Here's a [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) collection to play around with the API if you're interested: [https://www.postman.com/notionhq/workspace/notion-s-public-api-workspace/overview](https://www.postman.com/notionhq/workspace/notion-s-public-api-workspace/overview)

## ðŸš§ It's a work in progress

This is a source plugin for pulling content into Gatsby from official public Notion API (currently
in beta). With this plugin, you will be able to query your Notion pages in Gatsby using GraphQL.

[Notion API Reference](https://developers.notion.com/reference/intro)

[An example](https://gatsby-source-notion-api-demo.netlify.app)

[Here's my blog running on gatsby-source-notion-api](https://orlow.dev)

## Features

- Get your Notion pages in Gatsby via GraphQL
- Convenient access to page properties
- Page contents in Markdown!
- Normalised page title
- All blocks styling represented in Markdown:
  - **bold** (`**$VALUE**`)
  - _italic_ (`_$VALUE_`)
  - ~~strikethrough~~ (`~~$VALUE~~`)
  - <u>underline</u> (`<u>$VALUE</u>`)
  - `code` (`$VALUE`)
  - color ðŸ¤· (`<span notion-color="$COLOR">$VALUE</span>`)
- Access to raw data returned by Notion API
- Support for `markdown-remark` and `mdx`

## Install

```sh
yarn add gatsby-source-notion-api
```

or

```sh
npm install --save gatsby-source-notion-api
```

## How to use

Before using this plugin, make sure you

1. Created a Notion integration (sign in to Notion, go to `Settings & Memberships` â†’ `Integrations`
   â†’ `Develop your own integrations`,
   [short link to the Integrations creation section](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)). It's
   OK to use an internal one. Don't forget to copy the token:
   ![Notion integration creation GIF](https://files.readme.io/2ec137d-093ad49-create-integration.gif)
2. Go to the database you want to have access to from Gatsby, and share it with the integration (`Share` â†’ Select
   the integration in the `Invite` dropdown). Don't forget the database in the URL. It's a series of
   characters after the last slash and before the question mark.
   ![Notion integration sharing GIF](https://files.readme.io/0a267dd-share-database-with-integration.gif)
   Here's a reference:
   https://www.notion.so/{USER}/**{DATABASE_ID}**?{someotherirrelevantstuff}

Then add this to your `gatsby-config.json`:

```javascript
plugins: [
	{
		resolve: `gatsby-source-notion-api`,
		options: {
			token: `$INTEGRATION_TOKEN`,
			databaseId: `$DATABASE_ID`,
			propsToFrontmatter: true,
			lowerTitleLevel: true,
		},
	},
	// ...
]
```

## Configuration options

`token` [string][required]

Integration token.

`databaseId` [string][required]

The identifier of the database you want to get pages from. The integration identified by provided
token must have access to the database with given id.

`nodeTypeName` [string][optional]

Defines the name of the entity to be queried. For instance, a `nodeTypeName` of value `notionTeamMember` will allow creating queries named `allNotionTeamMember(...)`. Defaults to the string `"Notion"`.

This is particularly useful in case you want having multiple Notion databases.

`propsToFrontmatter` [boolean][defaults to **true**]

Put Notion page props to Markdown frontmatter. If you set this to **false**, you will need to query `notion` to get page props.

`lowerTitleLevel` [boolean][defaults to **true**]

Push headings one level down. # becomes ##, ## becomes ###, ### becomes ####. Notion is limited to only 3 levels of heading. You can create ####, #####, etc. - they will not be reflected in Notion, but they will work properly in the Markdown output. Is **true** by default.

## How to query for nodes

You can query for pages with `notion` or grab all of them with `allNotion`. The raw content of the
page is available under `raw` property.

### Query for all nodes

```graphql
query {
	allNotion {
		edges {
			node {
				id
				parent
				children
				internal
				title
				properties {
					My_Prop_1
					My_Prop_2
				}
				archived
				createdAt
				updatedAt
				markdown
				raw
			}
		}
	}
}
```

Alternatively, you can use MarkdownRemark or MDX directly:

```graphql
query {
	allMarkdownRemark {
		edges {
			node {
				frontmatter {
					title
				}
				html
			}
		}
	}
}
```

## Node properties

### `id`

Unique page identifier. This is not a Notion page identifier. You can get the Notion page id under `raw.id`.

### `parent` (Node)

Parend Node.

### `children`

Blocks that belong to the page.

### `title` (String)

Page title joined into one string.

### `properties`

Properties of the page. An object with keys representing database columns (snake-cased), and the following value:

#### `id` (String)

Notion column id

#### `key` (String)

Readable name of the column (without snake case).

#### `value` (\*)

Value of the column for the page. Might have different structure depending on the type.

#### `type` (String)

Notion type of the column.

### `archived` (Boolean)

Boolean. Is **true** if the pages was marked removed but not removed permanently.

### `createdAt` (Date)

Date of page creation.

### `updatedAt` (Date)

Date of the last page update.

### `raw` (\*)

Untouched contents of whatever Notion API returned.

### `markdown` (String)

Markdown contents of the page. Limited by blocks currently supported by Notion API. Unsupported blocks turn into HTML comments specifying that Notion marked this block as non-supported.

Since there's not semantic HTML analog for column lists and columns, these Notion blocks are transformed to `<ColumnList>` and `<Column>` components in the markdown. To customize these components, you can write custom components for these and [include them in your `MDXProvider`](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/mdx/importing-and-using-components#make-components-available-globally-as-shortcodes).

## Attaching images via "Files" property

If you want to turn images attached through the "Files" property into file nodes that you can use with gatsby-image, you need to attach remote file nodes to the "Files" property. In the example below, the `propsToFrontmatter` is set to **true** and the **_Hero Image_** Files property is used for images:

```javascript
// ./gatsby-node.js
exports.onCreateNode = async ({ node, actions: { createNode }, createNodeId, getCache }) => {
	if (node.internal.type === "MarkdownRemark") {
		for (let i = 0; i < node.frontmatter["Hero Image"].length; i++) {
			const name = node.frontmatter["Hero Image"][i].name

			if (!name) {
				continue
			}

			if (name.startsWith("http")) {
				const fileNode = await createRemoteFileNode({
					url: name,
					parentNodeId: node.id,
					createNode,
					createNodeId,
					getCache,
				})

				if (fileNode) {
					node.frontmatter["Hero Image"][i].remoteImage___NODE = fileNode.id
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

## Current state

- Due to the fact that Notion API only appeared recently, and it is still in beta, some blocks are
  marked "unsupported". Among others, images cannot be fetched for now
- ~~Currently, `gatsby-source-notion-api` can only work with one provided database. In further
  releases, all databases reachable by the Integration will be available for querying~~ Querying multiple databases is now supported! Please read the doc below.
- ~~Nested blocks are currently skipped. E.g. if a list item has a nested sublist, it's contents will
  be omitted. This will be fixed in the nearest releases~~ Nested blocks are supported as of `0.4.0`!
- ~~Only raw content is available. Raw meaning whatever Notion returns. Further releases will aim at
  providing a more convenient data format apart from the raw one~~ `0.3.0` features support for **archived**, **createdAt**, **updatedAt**, **properties** and **title**.

## Querying multiple databases

In order to query multiple databases, you can add multiple `gatsby-source-notion-api` in your projectâ€™s `gatsby-config.js` **and** set different `nodeTypeName` values. For instance:

```javascript
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-notion-api`,
      options: {
        token: `$INTEGRATION_TOKEN`,
        databaseId: `$DATABASE_ID`,
        nodeTypeName: "notionTeamMember",
        propsToFrontmatter: true,
        lowerTitleLevel: true,
      },
    },
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-notion-api`,
      options: {
        token: `$INTEGRATION_TOKEN`,
        databaseId: `$DATABASE_ID`,
        nodeTypeName: "notionTask",
        propsToFrontmatter: true,
        lowerTitleLevel: true,
      },
    },
  ],
```
